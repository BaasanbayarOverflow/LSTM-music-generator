Sonar is a project resulted from Machine learning case study :computer:. Sonar project's idea is motivated by an article
<a href='https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-2-a26a10b68df3'>Machine learning is fun part2</a>
by <a href='https://medium.com/@ageitgey'>Adam Geitgey</a> :raised_hands:. When i was reading this article, i found out that Super Mario game levels
can be generated from text file using RNN. So i thought that if i extract notes from music file and save those into text file all the other processes will be same as written in the article. That is where i started my own little case study. While doing my research i discovered LSTM RNN architecture is specifically designed to work with sequences of data and used it in my project.
