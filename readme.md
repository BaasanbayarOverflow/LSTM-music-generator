Sonar is a project resulted from Machine learning case study :computer:. Sonar project's idea is motivated by an article
<a href='https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-2-a26a10b68df3'>Machine learning is fun part2</a>
by <a href='https://medium.com/@ageitgey'>Adam Geitgey</a> :raised_hands:. When i was reading this article, i found out that Super Mario game levels
can be generated from text file using RNN. So i thought that if i extract notes from music file and save those into text file all the other processes will be same as written in the article. That is where i started my own little study. While doing my research i discovered LSTM RNN architecture is specifically
designed to work with sequences of data. LSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs
